These are Finnish language definitions, replacements and routines by Mervi Koinnotko, for use with Inform Library version 6/11 by Graham Nelson.

Most of the good parts came from the Russian Inform Library by Denis Gayev. The file with the Z-character table I took from the Swedish Library by Fredrik Ramsberg and renamed it as "fialpha", where I also translated the Inform banner. Two more routines from the Inform 6/11 Library were edited -- the Finnish language definition file replaces them. Many thanks!
