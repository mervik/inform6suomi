This is Inform Library version 6/11 with language definitions, replacements and routines for Finnish.

Most of the good parts in the Finnish Library were taken from the Russian Library by Denis Gayev, the Swedish Library by Fredrik Ramsberg and the IString Library by L. Ross Raszewski - many thanks!
